Hello and welcome to this course!

**Part II BBS Bioinformatics** - 15:00-17:00, 21 Jan 2019
1. We begin by working through the [Orientation](Orientation.md) exercise. You can either copy what I am doing on the screen or work through it faster on your own. Refer to [Notes](Notes.md) for some explanations and further examples.
2. Attempt the [Exercises](Exercises.md). [Answers](Answers.md) to exercises are available but please only check them once you have given the exercises a fair try. I will be walking around the room if you have any questions.
