# Introduction to R

Hello and welcome to this course!

**Part II BBS Bioinformatics** - 15:00-17:00, 21 Jan 2019
1. We begin by working through the [Tidyverse](Tidyverse.md) guided exercise. You can either copy what I am doing on the screen or work through it faster on your own. You may find [Notes](Notes.md) useful to brush up on some base R features and find further study resources.
2. Sections of [Exercises](Exercises.md) are linked within [Tidyverse](Tidyverse.md). We will pause to solve a couple of sections at a time. [Answers](Answers.md) to exercises are available but please only check them once you have given the exercises a fair try. I will be walking around the room if you have any questions.
